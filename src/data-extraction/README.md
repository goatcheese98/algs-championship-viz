```csv
Team,Game 1,Game 2,Game 3,Game 4,Game 5,Game 6,Overall Points
Falcons,16,30,11,3,19,20,99
Purple Slushee,3,1,4,16,8,19,51
GaiminGladiators,24,1,8,0,8,7,48
```

### 2. Bifurcated Format (`*-bifurcated.csv`)
**Purpose**: Detailed tooltip data showing placement vs. kill points breakdown
**Structure**: One row per team with separate placement (P) and kill (K) points for each game

```csv
Team,Game 1 P,Game 1 K,Game 2 P,Game 2 K,Game 3 P,Game 3 K,Overall Points
Falcons,4,12,12,18,5,6,99
Purple Slushee,1,2,1,0,1,3,51
GaiminGladiators,12,12,1,0,7,1,48
```

### Raw Data Format (Input)

## 🛠️ Format Conversion Tools

### 1. create-standard-formats.js (Recommended)
**Purpose**: One-stop solution for generating both standard formats
**Features**: 
- Generates both simple and bifurcated formats simultaneously
- Handles single files or entire directories
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Detailed conversion statistics

```bash
# Convert single file
node create-standard-formats.js "raw/Day1-WinnersRound1-3-fixed.csv" "processed" "Day1-WinnersRound1-3"

# Convert entire directory
node create-standard-formats.js --dir "raw" "processed"
```

### 2. Legacy Conversion Tools
- `format-converter.js` - Simple format only
- `create-bifurcated-format.js` - Bifurcated format only
- `convert-to-year4-format.js` - Batch simple format conversion

## 🏆 Tournament Data Pipeline

### Step 1: Data Extraction
```bash
# Run the scraper
node algs-scraper-working.js
```

### Step 2: Format Conversion
```bash
# Generate both standard formats
node create-standard-formats.js --dir "../../public/year5champions/raw" "../../public/year5champions/processed"
```

### Step 3: File Organization
**Raw Data** (`public/year5champions/raw/`):
- `Day1-WinnersRound1-3-fixed.csv` - Direct scraper output
- `Day2-LosersRound1-2-fixed.csv` - Additional tournament data

**Processed Data** (`public/year5champions/processed/`):
- `Day1-WinnersRound1-3-simple.csv` - Chart visualization format
- `Day1-WinnersRound1-3-bifurcated.csv` - Tooltip detail format

### Step 4: Dashboard Integration
The visualization system automatically detects and uses:
- **Simple format** for main charts and leaderboards
- **Bifurcated format** for detailed hover tooltips showing P/K breakdown

## 📋 File Naming Convention

All tournament files follow this standardized naming pattern:
```
{Day}{Round}-{suffix}.csv
```

**Examples**:
- `Day1-WinnersRound1-3-simple.csv`
- `Day2-LosersRound1-2-bifurcated.csv`
- `Finals-Day3-Championship-simple.csv`
