# 🚀 ALGS Y5 Data Scraper - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ Status: COMPLETE & WORKING

The ALGS Y5 tournament data scraper has been successfully implemented and tested with **100% accuracy**!

## 📊 Test Results

**Tested on:** Day 1 WinnersRound1-3 (https://apexlegendsstatus.com/algs/Y5-Split1/ALGS-Open/Global/Day1/WinnersRound1-3#tab_scores)

**Results:**
- ✅ **18 teams extracted** 
- ✅ **18 perfect matches** (100% accuracy)
- ✅ **0 mismatches**
- ✅ **Real team names** (Falcons, Purple Slushee, GaiminGladiators, etc.)
- ✅ **Correct ALGS scoring system** implemented

## 🎯 How to Use

### 1. Navigate to the scraper directory:
```bash
cd src/data-extraction
```

### 2. Install dependencies (if not already done):
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the working scraper:
```bash
node algs-scraper-working.js
```

### 4. Check the output files:
- `public/year5champions/raw/Day1-WinnersRound1-3-fixed.csv`
- `public/year5champions/processed/Day1-WinnersRound1-3-summary-fixed.csv`

## 📊 Step 3: Generate Standard Formats

The scraper extracts detailed data, but the dashboard requires two standardized formats. Convert the raw data to both formats:

```bash
# Navigate to data extraction directory
cd src/data-extraction

# Generate both standard formats for all raw data
node create-standard-formats.js --dir "../../public/year5champions/raw" "../../public/year5champions/processed"
```

This will create:
- ✅ **Simple format** (`*-simple.csv`) - Main visualization format
- ✅ **Bifurcated format** (`*-bifurcated.csv`) - Detailed tooltip format with P/K breakdown

**Example Output:**
```
🔄 Converting all files in ../../public/year5champions/raw...

✅ Day1-WinnersRound1-3-fixed conversion complete:
   📊 18 teams, 6 games
   🏆 Winner: Falcons (99 points)
   📁 Simple: Day1-WinnersRound1-3-fixed-simple.csv
   📁 Bifurcated: Day1-WinnersRound1-3-fixed-bifurcated.csv

📊 Conversion Summary:
   ✅ 1 files converted successfully
   📁 Output directory: ../../public/year5champions/processed
```

## 📋 Step 4: Rename Files (Optional)

For consistency, rename the files to follow the standard convention:

```bash
# Navigate to processed directory
cd ../../public/year5champions/processed

# Rename to standard format
ren "Day1-WinnersRound1-3-fixed-simple.csv" "Day1-WinnersRound1-3-simple.csv"
ren "Day1-WinnersRound1-3-fixed-bifurcated.csv" "Day1-WinnersRound1-3-bifurcated.csv"
```

## 🎯 Final File Structure

Your Year 5 tournament data should now be organized as:

```
public/year5champions/
├── raw/
│   └── Day1-WinnersRound1-3-fixed.csv         # Raw scraper output
└── processed/
    ├── Day1-WinnersRound1-3-simple.csv        # Main visualization format
    └── Day1-WinnersRound1-3-bifurcated.csv    # Tooltip detail format
```

## 📊 Data Formats Explained

### Simple Format
**Purpose**: Main charts and leaderboards
**Structure**: One row per team, total points per game
```csv
Team,Game 1,Game 2,Game 3,Game 4,Game 5,Game 6,Overall Points
Falcons,16,30,11,3,19,20,99
Purple Slushee,3,1,4,16,8,19,51
```

### Bifurcated Format
**Purpose**: Detailed tooltips showing placement vs. kill points
**Structure**: One row per team, separate P (placement) and K (kill) points
```csv
Team,Game 1 P,Game 1 K,Game 2 P,Game 2 K,Game 3 P,Game 3 K,Overall Points
Falcons,4,12,12,18,5,6,99
Purple Slushee,1,2,1,0,1,3,51
```

## 📋 Sample Output

### Game-by-game data:
```csv
Team,Rank,Game,Placement,Kills,Points
Falcons,1,1,5,12,16
Falcons,1,2,1,18,30
Falcons,1,3,4,6,11
Falcons,1,4,11,2,3
Falcons,1,5,1,7,19
Falcons,1,6,3,13,20
```

### Summary with validation:
```csv
Team,Rank,ExpectedTotal,CalculatedTotal,Difference,Status
Falcons,1,99,99,0,MATCH
Purple Slushee,2,51,51,0,MATCH
GaiminGladiators,3,48,48,0,MATCH
```

## 🏆 Key Features

1. **Correct ALGS Scoring**: Implements the exact point system (12/9/7/5/4/3/3/2/2/2/1/1/1/1/1/0 for placements + 1 point per kill)

2. **Perfect Validation**: Compares calculated totals against displayed totals with 100% accuracy

3. **Real Team Names**: Extracts actual team names like "Falcons", "Purple Slushee", etc.

4. **Proper Data Structure**: Correctly parses the table structure with Rank, Team, Total, then P-K-P-K pattern

5. **CSV Export**: Outputs clean CSV files ready for visualization

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Table Structure Understanding
- **Cell 0:** Team rank (#1, #2, etc.)
- **Cell 1:** Team name (Falcons, Purple Slushee, etc.)
- **Cell 2:** Total score (99, 51, 48, etc.)
- **Cell 3+:** Game data in P, K, P, K, P, K pattern

### Scoring Verification
Every extracted team shows:
```
Expected: 99 | Calculated: 99 | Diff: 0 ✅
```

## 🎮 Example: Team Falcons Analysis

**Team Falcons (Rank #1):**
- Game 1: 5th place (4 pts) + 12 kills (12 pts) = **16 points**
- Game 2: 1st place (12 pts) + 18 kills (18 pts) = **30 points**
- Game 3: 4th place (5 pts) + 6 kills (6 pts) = **11 points**
- Game 4: 11th place (1 pt) + 2 kills (2 pts) = **3 points**
- Game 5: 1st place (12 pts) + 7 kills (7 pts) = **19 points**
- Game 6: 3rd place (7 pts) + 13 kills (13 pts) = **20 points**

**Total: 16 + 30 + 11 + 3 + 19 + 20 = 99 points** ✅

## 📈 Next Steps

2. **Automation**: Create scripts to automatically scrape all tournament data
3. **Integration**: Connect the scraped data to your existing visualization system
4. **Live Updates**: Add real-time tournament monitoring capabilities
